KatByte 0.1.5 by techwizrd

==Description

KatByte is a multi-purpose editor developed for quick coding. From the start I disliked the interfaces of other editors, and so I set out to build my own. 

==Features

- Fast and simple
- Tabbed document support
- Syntax highlighting for many languages
- Opening files via command line arguements
- Ability to open files over sftp, ftp, etc. (thanks to GNOME's built in support.)
- more coming soon

==Install

Currently, there is no installer. Just execute katbyte.py and you're ready to go!

If you feel inclined to package this for your system, please do send me a copy. My email is theninja@bluedevs.net.
