This is a simple guide to hacking KatByte.

==Notes

All the real code has been moved to katbyte.py

I have currently deprecated EditorComponent.py, and menus.xml and the original catbyte.py were deprecated long before that (relatively long in my view of things).

If you would like to help coding, please read the TODO file, pick item you are interested in, and start HACKING away. Thank you in advance for contributing.

==Dependencies
PyGTK 2.4 or above
Python 2.4 or 2.5
GtkSourceView

Note: I (techwizrd) use Linux (Ubuntu specifically), and so I will cater to Linux. I have every intention of this being cross-platform, and I will try to adhere to standards as much as possible. However, I do not have ready access to a Windows/OS X/*BSD, so I will need people to test and package for these systems.

==Coding Style

For the most part, follow PEP 8, although I have a few requests.

- Use TABs for indentation, NOT spaces.
- Use CamelCasing for variable names, function names, class names, etc.
- Class names should start with an upper case letter, eg. ClassName not className
- Variable and function names should start with a lower case, eg. pythonRocks not PythonRocks

==Repository

We use git as our VCS/SCM of choice. It allows for easy N-way merging and is very fast at pulling repositories.
If you would like to contribute, we have a public github repository at http://github.com/techwizrd/catbyte
